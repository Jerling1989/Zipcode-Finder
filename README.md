# Zipcode-Finder
Zipcode-Finder is an app designed to help people find the zipcode of the address they enter. The app uses the Google Maps Geolocation API in order to find the relevant zipcode for whatever address the user may enter. The app was also built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.
